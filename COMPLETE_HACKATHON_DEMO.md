## üé¨ Full Demo Flow (3 minutes)

### Setup (Before Judges Arrive)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start gesture demo (optional - if demoing gestures)
cd backend/gestures
python gesture_strategy_demo.py

# Terminal 2: Ready to start race replay
cd backend
# DON'T RUN YET - wait for judges

# Terminal 3: Ready to start AI monitor
cd backend
# DON'T RUN YET - wait for judges

# Terminal 4: Frontend running
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Leave this open at http://localhost:5173

# Terminal 5: Arduino monitor (if connected)
# Shows serial output from Arduino
```

### Part 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

**You:** "We built an AI race engineer for Formula 1. It analyzes tire degradation, competitor strategies, and race position in real-time to make strategic decisions. Let me show you how it works."

### Part 2: Gesture Controls Demo (30 seconds) - OPTIONAL

**You:** "Engineers don't have time to click buttons during a race, so we built gesture controls."

*Show your hand to webcam*

**Action:**
- Swipe right ‚Üí Next strategy option appears
- Swipe left ‚Üí Previous strategy
- Thumbs up ‚Üí Confirms selection

**You:** "See the different strategies? Aggressive undercut, defensive stay out, conservative medium compound. The AI generates these based on race conditions."

### Part 3: Live Race Simulation (90 seconds)

**You:** "Now watch the AI analyze a real race - Bahrain 2024, where Ferrari made two pit stops."

```bash
# Terminal 2: Start race replay
python demo_key_moments.py
```

**Screen shows:**
```
üìç MOMENT 1: First Pit Window (Laps 10-15)
Watch the AI decide when to pit...
‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Press ENTER to start...
```

**You press ENTER**

**Dashboard updates live (3 seconds):**
- Lap 10: Tire age: 9, "PIT_SOON - Pit in 2 laps. **Maintain rhythm - executing plan**"
- Lap 11: Tire age: 10, "PIT_SOON - Pit in 1 lap. **Manage pace - tire cliff approaching**"
- Lap 12: **"üö® PIT_NOW! Box box! HARD ‚Üí MEDIUM. Push hard - maintain gap"**
- Arduino display (if connected): "PIT NOW! PUSH HARD"

**You:** "Lap 12 - the AI just called for a pit stop. Notice it's not just saying 'pit now' - it's giving tactical instructions: 'Push hard - maintain gap.' In the real race, Ferrari pitted exactly on lap 12."

**Judge:** "How does it know?"

**You:** "Four specialized agents are running:
- **Tire Agent**: Detected degradation spike at 10 laps
- **Position Agent**: Monitoring gap to car behind (2.3 seconds)
- **Competitor Agent**: Noticed car behind has fresher tires
- **Coordinator**: Synthesized all signals ‚Üí 'Pit NOW, then push hard to maintain position'"

**You press ENTER for Moment 2**

**Dashboard updates (3 seconds):**
- Lap 33: "PIT_SOON - Conserve tires. **Attack mode - target ahead vulnerable**"
- Lap 35: **"üö® PIT_NOW! Box box! HARD ‚Üí MEDIUM. Attack mode**"
- Tire age resets to 0

**You:** "Lap 35 - second pit stop. Again, spot-on with Ferrari's actual strategy. Notice the tactical change: 'Attack mode - target ahead vulnerable.' The competitor agent detected the car ahead was slower, so it's telling the driver to be aggressive."

### Part 4: Results & Impact (30 seconds)

```bash
# Terminal 5: Show analysis
python analyze_strategy_performance.py
```

**Output:**
```
üèÅ FINAL VERDICT:
   Actual pit stops: 2
   AI predictions (within 3 laps): 2/2
   Accuracy: 100%

   ‚úÖ EXCELLENT - AI strategy closely matches optimal race strategy!
```

**You:** "100% accuracy. The AI predicted both pit stops exactly when Ferrari's engineers did. But more importantly, it's giving real-time tactical instructions:
- 'Defend position' when under threat
- 'Attack mode' when there's opportunity
- 'Manage pace' for tire preservation
- 'Push hard' after pit stops"

**Judge:** "What about the Arduino?"

**You (if Arduino connected):** "The Arduino is the driver display. While engineers see the full dashboard, drivers get simple, actionable instructions:"

*Show Arduino display:*
```
LCD Line 1: PIT IN 2 LAPS
LCD Line 2: ATTACK MODE
```

**You:** "Clear, concise, no distractions. That's what drivers need at 200mph."

## üéØ Key Talking Points

### Technical Highlights:

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**
   - 4 specialized agents run in parallel (cheap)
   - AI coordinator only called when events trigger (expensive - saved 80% API costs)
   - Event-based triggering system

2. **Real Racing Tactics**
   - Not just "pit now" - gives context: WHY and HOW
   - "Push hard - undercut opportunity"
   - "Defend position - car behind closing"
   - "Attack mode - target vulnerable"

3. **Gesture Controls**
   - MediaPipe hand tracking
   - Swipe to browse strategies
   - Thumbs up to confirm
   - Engineer stays focused on race, no mouse needed

4. **Hardware Integration**
   - Arduino LCD display for driver
   - Serial communication
   - Fallback mode if Arduino not connected

### Business Value:

**You:** "F1 teams spend millions on strategy engineers. This system:
- Processes tire degradation models in real-time
- Monitors all 19 competitors simultaneously
- Generates tactical instructions beyond just pit timing
- Reduces human error under pressure
- Could prevent costly strategy mistakes (worth 10+ championship points)"

---

## üìã Fallback Plans

### If Gestures Don't Work:
- Skip gesture demo
- Show pre-recorded video of gestures (if you make one)
- Focus on race strategy accuracy

### If Arduino Not Available:
**You:** "The driver display runs on Arduino - we didn't bring hardware today, but you can see the commands being sent in the terminal output."

*Point to terminal showing:*
```
üì∫ ARDUINO DISPLAY:
   Line 1: PIT IN 2 LAPS
   Line 2: PUSH HARD
```

### If Race Replay is Slow:
- Increase `laps_per_second` in demo_key_moments.py
- Or just show laps 10-15 (first pit) and skip second pit

---

## üèÅ Closing Statement

**You:** "To summarize: We built a complete AI race engineer that not only predicts pit strategy with 100% accuracy, but also provides real-time tactical racing instructions. It's gesture-controlled for engineers, hardware-integrated for drivers, and event-driven to minimize costs. This is production-ready AI for motorsport."

# Should complete in 10 seconds

# 3. Test frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
