# F1 AI Race Strategy System - Demo Script

## Opening (30 seconds)

**"Welcome to the F1 AI Race Strategy System - a real-time intelligent racing assistant that combines live telemetry data, multi-agent AI architecture, and gesture-based controls to help you dominate the track."**

---

## Section 1: System Overview (1 minute)

**"What you're looking at is a complete race strategy system powered by real Formula 1 data. Here's what makes this special:**

- **Live F1 Data**: Using FastF1 library, we pull authentic telemetry from actual Grand Prix races
- **Historical Race Simulation**: We're running the 2024 Bahrain Grand Prix - you can race against real competitors like Verstappen, Leclerc, and Hamilton
- **Multi-Agent AI Architecture**: Four specialized data agents work together, coordinated by a Gemini 2.0 Flash AI
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Get strategic recommendations as the race unfolds
- **Gesture Control**: Swipe through strategies and make decisions without touching a keyboard"

---

## Section 2: The 4 Data Agents (1.5 minutes)

**"Let me show you our four specialized data agents. Each one monitors a critical aspect of race performance."**

### 1. **Tire Agent** (Click to open)
**"The Tire Agent is your tire whisperer. It tracks:**
- Current compound (Soft, Medium, or Hard)
- Tire age and degradation rate
- Real-time wear patterns
- Optimal pit window recommendations

*Show tire degradation percentage updating live*

**"See this degradation percentage? It's calculating in real-time based on the tire model, track temperature, and driving style. When degradation hits critical levels, the agent triggers an alert."**

### 2. **Lap Time Agent** (Click to open)
**"The Lap Time Agent analyzes your pace:**
- Current lap time vs. average
- Sector-by-sector performance
- Trend analysis (improving or degrading)
- Comparison against competitors

**"Notice it's tracking whether you're getting faster or slower - crucial for knowing if your tires are falling off a cliff."**

### 3. **Position Agent** (Click to open)
**"The Position Agent is your tactical radar:**
- Live race positions (we filter out DNFs and lapped cars for accuracy)
- Gap ahead and gap behind
- Battle tracking - who's fighting for position
- Position history throughout the race

**"We're only showing drivers who completed the full race distance for accurate comparisons. No artificial inflation from DNF drivers."**

### 4. **Competitor Agent** (Click to open)
**"This is where it gets cool - the McLaren-style Competitor Dashboard:**
- Side-by-side telemetry comparison
- YOUR data on the left in blue, COMPETITOR on the right in yellow
- Live speed, throttle, brake, and DRS data
- Track position visualization
- Weather and tire strategy comparison

**"This gives you real-time intel on what your rival is doing - are they faster in corners? Are they managing their tires better?"**

---

## Section 3: The Coordinator AI Agent (2 minutes)

**"Now here's the brain of the operation - our Coordinator Agent powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash."**

### How It Works:
**"The Coordinator doesn't just make random suggestions. It:**

1. **Polls all 4 data agents** through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface
2. **Synthesizes the data** - tire wear + lap times + position + competitor intel
3. **Generates strategic options** - should you pit now? Stay out? Push harder? Conserve tires?
4. **Evaluates each option** with pros, cons, and predicted race time impact

*Point to strategy cards appearing*

**"Look at these strategy cards. Each one shows:**
- The decision (Pit Now, Stay Out, Extend Stint)
- Predicted lap time impact
- Total race time impact
- Pros and cons
- AI confidence level

**The Coordinator is using MCP to query each agent:**
- 'Tire Agent, what's our degradation status?'
- 'Position Agent, who's around us?'
- 'Lap Time Agent, are we losing pace?'
- 'Competitor Agent, what's Verstappen doing?'

**Then it synthesizes all this into actionable intelligence."**

---

## Section 4: Live Decision Making (1.5 minutes)

**"Let's make a strategic decision. We're on Lap 18, tires are getting old..."**

*Show strategy carousel with 3 options*

**"The AI is presenting three options:**

1. **Pit Now for Mediums** - Lose track position but get fresh tires
2. **Stay Out 3 More Laps** (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) - Undercut window
3. **Pit for Hards** - One-stop strategy to the end

**"Notice the AI recommends option 2 - staying out. Why? Let's look:**
- Our tire degradation is at 12%, still manageable
- We're in a good position to undercut the cars ahead
- The pit window analysis shows laps 21-24 are optimal

**"I'm going to select the AI recommendation..."**

*Select strategy card*

**"And now the race continues with that strategy locked in. The system tracks our decision and adapts future recommendations accordingly."**

---

## Section 5: Gesture Control (1 minute)

**"Here's my favorite feature - gesture control. In a race, you don't have time to click around."**

*Demonstrate gestures*

### Swipe Right (show gesture)
**"Swipe right → next strategy option"**

### Swipe Left (show gesture)
**"Swipe left → previous strategy option"**

### Tap (show gesture)
**"Tap → select current strategy"**

**"There's even a 2-second cooldown to prevent accidental spam. This means you can keep your hands on the wheel and make split-second decisions with simple gestures."**

**"The gesture server runs independently, polling for hand movements at 30fps and sending commands to the dashboard in real-time."**

---

## Section 6: Real vs. Simulated Performance (1.5 minutes)

**"Here's what makes this powerful - we're using REAL historical race data from FastF1."**

**"We loaded the 2024 Bahrain Grand Prix:**
- Actual lap times for every driver
- Real tire strategies
- Actual pit stop windows
- Historical weather data

**"But YOU'RE making different decisions. The system compares your strategy to what actually happened."**

*Show race progress*

**"Right now, I'm running a different tire strategy than Leclerc did in the real race. The AI is calculating:**
- Would this strategy have beaten his actual race time?
- Am I gaining or losing positions compared to reality?
- What's my predicted final position?

**At the end of the race..."**

*Show race completion modal*

**"You get a full breakdown:**
- Your final position vs. actual race results
- Full leaderboard with finishing times
- Gap analysis - how close were you to the podium?
- Strategy comparison - did your pit stops work better?

**"This is based on REAL data. Verstappen's time here? That's his actual race time from Bahrain 2024."**

2. **Have multiple strategy decisions ready** to show AI adaptation
3. **Demonstrate both accepting and rejecting AI recommendations** to show it's not on rails
4. **Show the competitor dashboard** - it's visually impressive
5. **Practice gesture controls** beforehand - they need to be smooth
6. **Have the race completion modal ready** to show final comparison
7. **Keep FastF1 data loaded** to avoid loading delays during demo

## Q&A Prep

**Q: "How accurate is the tire model?"**
A: "We use a physics-based degradation model calibrated against actual F1 lap time data. While simplified vs. real F1 teams' models, it captures the key behaviors - linear wear, temperature effects, and cliff degradation."

**Q: "Can you add real-time races?"**
A: "FastF1 updates within hours of a race finishing. We could connect to their live timing API for real-time data during actual Grand Prix weekends."

**Q: "Why Gemini 2.0 Flash?"**
A: "Sub-second response times are critical in racing. Gemini 2.0 Flash gives us the reasoning capability we need with the speed we require - decisions in under 500ms."

**Q: "How does MCP work here?"**
A: "Each agent exposes a structured interface - the coordinator queries 'get_tire_status()' or 'get_position_data()' and receives formatted responses. This keeps agents modular and the coordinator's prompts clean."

**Q: "What about weather effects?"**
A: "Currently using historical weather data. Rain completely changes strategy - intermediates, full wets, timing of dry line formation. That's a future enhancement."

**Q: "Can I race different tracks?"**
A: "Yes! FastF1 has data for the full 2024 season. Each track has unique characteristics - Monaco vs. Monza require completely different strategies."
