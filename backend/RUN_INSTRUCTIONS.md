# How to Run the Interactive Race Simulator

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Demo Mode (RECOMMENDED FOR DEMOS)
**~5-8 decisions only - perfect for demonstrations**

```bash
cd /Users/harsh/Documents/GitHub/HackTX/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python run_interactive_simulator.py --demo
```

**What you'll see:**
- Lap 1: Choose driving style (BALANCED/AGGRESSIVE/QUALI_MODE)
- Lap 21: Pit decision (tire at 85% of max life)
- Lap 44: Second pit decision (if needed)
- Lap 57: Final results with leaderboard

**Demo takes:** ~2-3 minutes

---

### Option 2: Full Mode
**~25 decisions - detailed strategy experience**

```bash
cd /Users/harsh/Documents/GitHub/HackTX/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python run_interactive_simulator.py
```

**What you'll see:**
- Many decision points throughout the race
- Detailed tire state information
- Every strategic opportunity presented

**Full mode takes:** ~10-15 minutes

## Testing Features

### Test 1: Demo Mode Decision Count
```bash
python -c "
from interactive_race_simulator import InteractiveRaceSimulator

sim = InteractiveRaceSimulator(2024, 'Bahrain', 57, 'VER', demo_mode=True)
sim.start_race()

decision_count = 0
for lap in range(1, 58):
    if sim.should_offer_decision(lap):
        decision_count += 1

print(f'Demo mode decisions: {decision_count}')
"
```

Expected: 5-8 decisions

### Test 2: Full Mode Decision Count
```bash
python -c "
from interactive_race_simulator import InteractiveRaceSimulator

sim = InteractiveRaceSimulator(2024, 'Bahrain', 57, 'VER', demo_mode=False)
sim.start_race()

decision_count = 0
for lap in range(1, 58):
    if sim.should_offer_decision(lap):
        decision_count += 1

print(f'Full mode decisions: {decision_count}')
"
```

Expected: ~25 decisions

### Test 3: Dynamic Behavior (User Ignores AI)
```bash
python test_continuous_stay_out.py
```

Shows what happens when user keeps choosing "Stay Out" even when AI says NOT_RECOMMENDED.

### Test 4: Pit Window Selector
```bash
python pit_window_selector.py
```

Shows the new pit window timeline UX.

## Tips for Best Demo Experience

1. **Use Demo Mode** (`--demo` flag)
   - Only 5-8 decisions
   - Keeps demo moving
   - Shows critical moments

2. **Follow Highly Recommended (‚≠ê)**
   - Best chance to beat VER
   - Shows AI working correctly

3. **Or Deliberately Ignore AI**
   - Pick NOT_RECOMMENDED options
   - Shows tire cliff penalty
   - Demonstrates dynamic response

4. **Show the Decision Context**
   - Point out tire age percentage
   - Explain why decision triggered
   - Show AI adapting to choices

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Module not found: fastf1"
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastf1
```

### Error: "No such file: race_data.pkl"
This is normal - FastF1 will download data on first run (takes ~30 seconds)

### Race takes too long
Use `--demo` flag for faster experience

### Want to test without interaction
```bash
python test_dynamic_ai.py  # Auto-follows AI recommendations
```

## Next Steps

### For Frontend Integration:

1. Import the simulator:
```python
from interactive_race_simulator import InteractiveRaceSimulator

sim = InteractiveRaceSimulator(2024, 'Bahrain', 57, 'VER', demo_mode=True)
```

2. Generate decisions as JSON:
```python
options = sim.generate_decision_options(current_lap)
return json.dumps([{
    'id': opt.option_id,
    'title': opt.title,
    'description': opt.description,
    'confidence': opt.ai_confidence,
    'race_impact': opt.predicted_race_time_impact,
    'reasoning': opt.reasoning,
    'pros': opt.pros,
    'cons': opt.cons
} for opt in options])
```

3. Use Pit Window Selector:
```python
from pit_window_selector import PitWindowSelector

selector = PitWindowSelector(sim.tire_model, sim.total_laps)
window = selector.generate_pit_window(...)
# Returns timeline data for React component
```
